Application Menu
################

The application menu appears in the top-left corner of the application and is configured using the following two settings:

* :code:`:app-menu-download: true/false` - Show the download link. This requires that the content is served via the TutorialServer.
* :code:`:app-menu-jupyterhub: true/false` - Show the JupyterHub home / logout links. This requires that the content is provided via a JupyterHub.
